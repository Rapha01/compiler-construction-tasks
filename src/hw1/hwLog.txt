Added a print line to the beginning of selfie() method

hw1
Added constants for sll and srl f3 and f7 codes, according to documentation
In decode_execute() there is already a distinction between OP codes and the decoding of their instruction typs.
	Accoding to docu, sll and srl Op code is 51(in selfie OP_OP), like ADD, SUB,..
	Added distinction (if-clauses) for sll (F3_SLL = 1 && F7_SLL = 0) and srl (F3_SRL = 5 && F7_SRL = 0)
	We now know when we are dealing with a sll or srl operation - now we start do_sll()/do_srl() to tigger their semantics/effects on the machine
	Copied and adjusted debug code from other instruction
In do_sll()/do_srl()
	According to documentation, all sll/srl operations read the rs1 and rs2 registers as source operands and write the result into register rd
	So the semantics/code for do_sll()/do_srl() is the same as do_add(), only instead of a addition between rs1 and rs2, we use the selfie library functions to leftshift/rightshift(the bitsequence rs1, by rs2 bits)
	Of course we also have to increment the program counter
Added debug constants ic_sll/ic_srl, their semantics and output
